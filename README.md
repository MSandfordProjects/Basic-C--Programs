## Daily Report Assignment
This project allows a user, specifically a student to be able to input a daily report about their studies.

## Method Class Assignment
This project allows a user to input 2 numbers which then it does multiplication on.

## Operators Assignment
This Assignment taught me how to compare two inputs to see if they are equal and give an output based on the information given.

## Package Express Assignement
This project allows for an individual to be able to input their package specifications and be able to get an estimated price based on
the package size with a base set shipping fee.

## Twenty One Game
This program is a basic game of Twenty One, which is a casino Black Jack game that can be played with a dealer. You can set
bets, hit, stay and leave once you're finished.
